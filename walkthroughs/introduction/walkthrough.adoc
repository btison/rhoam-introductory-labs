= Red Hat OpenShift API Management Service Discovery

This lab provides an introduction to {rhoam-name}, also known as {rhoam-acronym}.

In essence {rhoam-acronym} is {3scale-name} delivered as an addon for
{osd-name} ({osd-acronym}). Both {osd-acronym}, and the {rhoam-acronym} addon
running on top of it,Â are managed by Red Hat SRE and have a 99.95% SLA. The
following image provides a high-level architecture overview of {rhoam-acronym}:

It is assumed you have access to a {rhoam-acronym} environment from this point forward.
You can get access by:

. Requesting it from a lab instructor (if you're following this content as part of an instructor led lab)
. Provisioning an environment of your own at link:{ocm-url}[cloud.redhat.com, window="_blank"] using the following instructions:
.. link:{https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_api_management/1/}[Official Documentation]
.. link:{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd2TlBm5KHs}[Video Instructions]

Verify you have a development environment with the following configured before continuing:

* OpenShift (`oc`) CLI v4.6.x
* Git CLI
* Local Java environment with Maven installed

==  Accessing your Environment

If you're in an instructor-led lab your instructor will provide you with the OpenShift console URL.

If you've chosen to provision your own environment you can access the OpenShift console using the following steps:

. Login to link:{ocm-url}[cloud.redhat.com, window="_blank"].
. Navigate to the link:{ocm-url/openshift/}[clusters list, window="_blank"].
. Select the cluster that has the {rhoam-name} addon installed.
. Click the *Open Console* button from the Overview screen.

A screenshot of the Overview screen is provided for reference.

Once you've been provided with a URL to your environment, you will be able to login using a configured IdP (identity provider).
Any available IdPs are listed on the OpenShift login screen as shown in the following screenshot.

image::images/lab1-login.png[OpenShift Login Screen, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

Choose the appropriate IdP and login. You should be redirected to the {osd-name} console.

Documentation for {osd-name} IdP configuration is available at link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/4/authentication/dedicated-understanding-authentication.html[this link].

== Accessing Red Hat {3scale-name} and Red Hat {sso-name}

Now that you've successfully logged into your {osd-acronym} cluster you can access the managed {3scale-name} and {sso-name} instances.

The procedure is the same for both products.

. Click the Application Launcher icon in the {osd-name} console. This the square icon in the top-right.
. Select *API Management* to access {3scale-name}, or *API Management SSO* to access {sso-name}.
. A new browser tab will open and prompt you to login. Login using your IdP.
. You will be redirected to the applicable product console after successfully authenticating with your IdP.

This is a screenshot the {3scale-name} console:

And this is a screenshot of the {sso-name} console:

== Create a Project on {osd-name}

As part of this lab you'll deploy a Quarkus application for use in future labs.
To deploy the Quarkus application you must first create a project.
Here's how to do that:

. Navigate to the {osd-name} Console.
. Click your name in the top-right, then click *Copy Login Command*.
. Login using you IdP if necessary, and click *Display Token*.
. Copy the `oc login` command and paste it into a terminal in your local development environment.

You should be successfully logged in and able to use the OpenShift CLI now.
Verify this by creating a project using the following commands:

----
# change this to be unique using your name
export PROJECT_NAME=yourname-lab

oc new-project $PROJECT_NAME
----

Here's an image showing these commands running in a terminal:

image::images/lab1-oc-project.png[Using oc CLI to create a project, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

== Test the Quarkus Application and Deploy to {osd-name}

Get started by cloning the link:{https://github.com/evanshortiss/rhoam-quarkus-openapi}[Quarkus application Git repository] to your development environment.

----
git clone https://github.com/evanshortiss/rhoam-quarkus-openapi
----

Run and test the application locally:

. Start the development server using `./mvnw quarkus:dev`
. Visit link:http://localhost:8080/fruits[localhost:8080/fruits].
. Verify that a list of fruits is returned in JSON format.
. Visit link:http://localhost:8080/openapi?format=json[localhost:8080/openapi?format=json] to verify that an OpenAPI Spec is returned.


If all is working as expected, deploy the application using the following commands:

----
oc project $PROJECT_NAME
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -Dquarkus.openshift.expose=true
----

The build process can take up to 2 minutes.
While it's in you can view the logs by visiting the *Builds* section of your project as shown.

image::images/lab1-build.png[Build Configs, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

Once the build is complete issue the `oc get route` command to find the URL for your Quarkus application.
Verify that the `/fruits` and `/openapi?format=json` endpoints are working as expected since these are required for the next lab.

You're now ready for Lab 2!
